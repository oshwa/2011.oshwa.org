					<description><![CDATA[I would love to attend the event but I&#039;m having difficulty with travel.  Live streaming, particularly interactive, would be pretty incredible.  If there is any way to figure out the cost, perhaps those of us who are far away could assemble a donation pot of some kind?]]></description>

Hi Mike

Alicia has asked me to video the event for later webcast and I have promised to do so. A live webcast is still a possibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Video streaming or video download after event would be great!

There is many of us from around the world who can not make it to the event :(
This would also enable us to keep our CO2 footprint low since we would not have to travel :)

All the best!]]></description>
