					<description><![CDATA[i very much like two of the winning designs.

i must say i am against anything that contains words of a sepcific human language in it, this will divide the effort and split the logo amongst the various human languages.

 a single letter like &#039;C&#039; is OK, its simple enough and sort of universal.

good luck]]></description>

Ooooups !

I missed the explanation on the main page. Sorry for that.

Most of the fraud have been done through a proxy, however, 204.128.27.8 belongs to http://www.physio-control.com/
http://whois.domaintools.com/204.128.27.8

Timestamp for the attacks should allow to easily trace back whoever did it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/oshw-logo-selection/#comment-249&quot;&gt;J. Simmons&lt;/a&gt;.

I fail to see how it settles down. The &quot;outrageous amount of votes&quot; for &quot;Copyleft Chip&quot; and then for &quot;Geared&quot; as the designer for this entry (user &quot;Aestros&quot;) mentions have not been corrected yet.

The graphics on the micropoll page shows 3988 votes for Sunday march 27th (more than 10 times the average for other days), but it will go away tomorrow as the daily historic data is kept for 7 days. I guess then, without any remaining traces, &quot;Copyleft Chip&quot; will win by a wide margin.

However, if you have a look at the calculation I posted earlier, you&#039;ll see  around 2500 votes going for it on the 27th. Using 420 votes (the highest voter turnout for other days this week) as a reference and even giving 35% of these real votes to it, there are still (2500 - (420*.35))=2353 fraudulent votes. And my calculation was when there was only 2777 votes, more than 1200 other highly suspicious votes were added later during that day.

As of now, here are the vote counts for the first 3 main contenders, Blue orb ( 2124 votes), Copyleft chip (4403 votes) and geared (2246 votes). Remove my very conservative count of fraudulent votes and you get :
- geared (2246 votes and maybe less as the author himself mentions),
- Blue orb ( 2124 votes minus 3 = 2121 because during my tests, I managed to vote 4 times ;-) ),
- Copyleft chip (4403-2353=2050 votes).

We&#039;ll see what the official result is, but IMHO, the whole process was so blatantly rigged the result should be discarded no matter who &quot;wins&quot;.]]></description>
