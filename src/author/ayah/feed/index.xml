										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We at the Open hardware Summit work very hard to keep the summit accessible to all people and companies, big or small. We keep the ticket prices affordable (even with meals, cocktails, a kickass lineup and a goodie bag to die for!), we cap sponsorship levels, and we plan a scholarship for open hardware with the remaining funds. But in order to do this, we need your help! <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/sponsor-2011">Please consider supporting the Open Hardware Summit 2011 by being a sponsor</a>. Different levels are available, and (besides making history), the benefits are totally worth it!</p>
<h2>Thank you to people who have already Sponsored for 2011. </strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[* * * Submission deadline extended until July 1st, 2011 * * * The Open Hardware Summit (OHS) invites submissions for the second annual summit, to be held on September [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>* * * Submission deadline extended until July 1st, 2011 * * *</h2>
<p>The Open Hardware Summit (OHS) invites submissions for the second annual summit, to be held on <strong>September 15, 2011</strong> in New York City (Venue TBA). The<a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/"> Open Hardware Summit</a> is a venue to present, discuss, and learn about open hardware of all kinds. The summit examines open hardware and its relation to other issues, such as software, design, business, and law. We are seeking submissions for talks, breakout sessions, and demos from individuals and groups working with open hardware and related areas. <del datetime="2011-06-24T15:04:41+00:00">Submissions are due <strong>by June 24, 2011</strong></del>. Deadline extended until <strong>July 1st</strong>.  Notification of accepted proposals will happen <strong>by August 1st</strong>.</p>
<p>Since the first Open Hardware Summit in 2010, we have seen the open hardware movement continue to flourish. The <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW">Open-Source Hardware Definition was announced</a>, the <a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/2011/04/07/oshw-logo-selected/">OSHW logo was selected by a popular vote</a>, an open source oil spill cleaning robot <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cesarminoru/protei-open-hardware-oil-spill-cleaning-sailing-ro">got more than $33,000 in crowd funding</a>, Google adopted the open hardware movement’s biggest success story, <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/05/google-picks-arduino-for-android-open-accessory-kit.html">Arduino, as its platform</a> and our very own keynote speaker, Limor Fried, was <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2011/03/16/thank-you-makers/">featured on the front page of Wired Magazine</a> – to name a few. Needless to say, open hardware is getting BIG.</p>
<h2>Submission topics</h2>
<p>Topics of interest for the summit include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lessons learned from past projects</li>
<li>Legal and intellectual property implications of open-source hardware</li>
<li>Means of supporting collaboration and community interaction</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Distributed development and its relationship to physical goods</li>
<li>Digital fabrication (e.g. laser cutters and 3D printers)</li>
<li>Software design tools (CAD / CAM)</li>
<li>DIY technology</li>
<li>Ways to share information about hardware that’s not captured in source files</li>
<li>Business models</li>
<li>Manufacturing on demand</li>
<li>Competition and collaboration</li>
<li>Sustainability of open hardware products (e.g. how to unmake things)</li>
<li>Industrial design</li>
<li>“open-washing” (green washing for open source)</li>
<li>Open-hardware in the enterprise</li>
<li>Specific product domains: e.g. science, agriculture, communications, medicine</li>
</ul>
<p>And any other topic you think relates to openness and hardware. We want to hear all about it!</p>
<h2>Types of submissions</h2>

<li>Talk submissions primarily containing marketing for a product will not be accepted. However, talks that share knowledge and insight derived from work on commercial products are welcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breakout session</h3>
<ul>
<li>Depending on submissions, there may be an opportunity to organize breakout sessions with smaller groups (5-40) to discuss a particular topic</li>
<li>We expect breakout sessions to occur during a single time-slot of approximately 1 to 2 hours.</li>

<li>You are encouraged to co-author breakout session submissions with other interested parties but sessions will be open to general summit attendees.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[As some members of the community pointed out, last Saturday, we saw a sudden surge in voting percentage for one of the logos up for public vote (see comments here). [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As some members of the community pointed out, last Saturday, we saw a sudden surge in voting percentage for one of the logos up for public vote (see comments <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/oshw-logo-selection/#comments">here</a>). After some investigation, turns out some people had written scripts to register a large number of votes on the same IP addresses. As one of the readers Aestros said: &#8220;Who ever is that [person] is, he is so stupid. I mean, what’s the purpose ? [&#8230;] [The point] wasn’t to beat the previous entry, it was to contribute to the community effort&#8221;.</p>
<p>The culprits are</p>
<p><strong>IP                                #Votes<br />
</strong>66.232.100.247         1365<br />
66.232.107.140          1155<br />
x.x.x.x                          577 (see below)<br />
87.106.215.227          435<br />
204.128.27.8             167</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} --><em>One of the ip addresses not shown was for OSHW advocate <a href="http://www.billporter.info/">Bill Porter</a>. Concerned about the spike in voting, he tested the security of the voting system and reported the issue to Open Hardware Summit personally.</em></p>
<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve enabled security checks, and multiple voting is no longer possible. But that still leaves us with 3,122 faulty votes, which micropoll.com refuses to disqualify.</p>
<p>So we are going to do this manually on closing day (April 5th), and adjust for the surge due to cheating. In the meantime, if you are one of these IP addresses, and had good intentions, please comment below, and tell us who you voted for (we can see your IP in the comments). If you were ill-intentioned, and subsequently, will not fess up, SHAME ON YOU. It&#8217;s people like you that make the work of a hard working community so difficult, and frustrating. But the community is stronger than you, and this is not going to stop everyone&#8217;s good efforts.</p>
<p>So go play bully somewhere else&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>others, VOTING STILL OPEN TILL APRIL 5th: CAST YOUR VOTE <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/oshw-logo-selection">HERE</a></strong></p>
<p>Thanks everyone for helping out..</p>

<p>On February 10th, 2011, we launched the Open Hardware Definition v1.0, and launched a competition to select an OSHW Logo. <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/oshw-logo-v1-0/">Over 129 submissions</a> have come in over 2 weeks, and a very active discussion on the <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/forum">forums</a>.</p>
<p>The selection of the OSHW Definition logo occurred in 2 stages:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, an invited selection committee reviewed and narrowed down the submissions (over 129) to the top 10 logos. The selection committee consisted of some of the most instrumental people in pushing forward/developing/writing/promoting the Open Hardware Definition (full list of members can be found <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/oshw-logo-selection/">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong> we open those <strong>10 logos</strong> to a PUBLIC VOTE and have the community select the top logo. Cast your vote <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/oshw-logo-selection/">here</a>! <strong>Deadline is April 5th.</strong></p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget to tweet, retweet, promote, forward. Let the OSHW community make its voice heard!</p>
<p>thanks<br />
