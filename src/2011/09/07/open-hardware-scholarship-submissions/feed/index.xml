					<description><![CDATA[My ideal AR tablet
http://blog.novologic.com/2009/07/augmented-reality-ar.html

Has anyone created a common comparison format/standard for hardware devices (tvs, monitors, cell phones, pdas, washing machines, autos, motorcycles, etc.)? this would make it easy to port data and compare devices easily. Could amazon or others (create a standards group) set the standard, then license it?

Saw some tech magazine showing an article on a company (hardwire) creating woven steel for military use vehicles (lighter, stronger and bulletproof).
My question is - can we incorporate this technology into cars, buildings, housing or furniture?

Is there a hardware device that will allow any PC to be used by 2 or more users -simultaneously?
http://rantd.blogspot.com/2008/01/more-to-share.html
Ideally, the other users would have another screen (to view), keyboard, and mouse.  Worst case scenario - users could share a split screen.  But just imagine how this might help the poorer communities.  Maybe even help curb some eco waste.  Great for coffeeshops that share wifi/pcs.  Could this be done remotely (like logmein.com)?
