					<description><![CDATA[Just FYI: the voting page is pretty badly rendered in most of the browsers I tested (IE/Chrome/FF on Win7, Chrome on Linux); the background doesn&#039;t appear to surround the voting choices, and there&#039;s little visible boxes around every section of the screen.

But, voting still works. :) Great job on narrowing down the selection; that was a ton of logos to go through!]]></description>
