IP addresses have already been given up (above). And anyway, turns out the person used a proxy!

Maybe next time do a little reading before you troll?]]></description>

I totally agree!
Also using a poll system which does not limit a vote to at least an IP address is very amateurish, imo it should be limited to an ip and an email address.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well... until a system exists there will be an hacker (or a lamer) that tries to force that system.
This is in the spirit of hacking since the beginning of our technological history and this spirit (bad or good that it is) is the source of open source community and open hardware projects.
We are all hackers (or lamers).

Now... I really don&#039;t understand why someone would be so stupid to cheat a voting machine just to have it&#039;s logo selected!
I understand instead that if the system for voting you are using is hackable you cannot complain about what other people do with your system :)

Go and fix it! Computers don&#039;t need morality!
I know the voting system is not your system ... cancel the votation and do it again with another system that is supposed to be bug free ;)]]></description>

Bill, hackers will be hackers. Welcome to the community. 1) Don&#039;t use a cheap, spammy, free 3rd party hosted poll. 2) Have some sense and turn on security in the first place.

Hackaday.com etc should NOT give up anyone&#039;s IP addresses.

To sum it up, you&#039;re a complete retard with nothing better to do. Go kill yourself.]]></description>
