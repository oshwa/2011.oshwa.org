<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">Some members from the 2011 dream team with Ayah &amp; Alicia</span></p>
<p>After two amazing and inspiring iterations (<a href="http://opensource.com/life/11/9/success-second-year-open-hardware-summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/the-genius-minds-open-hardware-summit-6843446.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2010</a>), we are excited to announce we are passing the Open Hardware Summit torch!</p>
<p>We had an amazing two years:&nbsp;we collectively created the&nbsp;<a href="http://arduino.cc/blog/2011/02/10/open-source-hardware-definition-v-1-0-released/?lang=it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first OSHW definition&nbsp;</a>(which has been adopted by CERN),<a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/2011/04/07/oshw-logo-selected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;communally created a logo for our movement</a>, grew into a community&nbsp;that supports each other on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forums</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/mailing-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailing lists&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/09/open-hardware-summit-sponsorship-goals-reached-thank-you.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsorships</a>, launched the first&nbsp;<a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/2011/09/07/open-hardware-scholarship-submissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Hardware Scholarship</a>, turned a conference&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johngineer/6167191118/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goodie bag</a>&nbsp;into something you would wrestle over, and created a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/open_hardware_summit/sets/72157627583343095/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geek red carpet that would have the Oscar&#8217;s drooling</a>!</p>
<p>It was inspiring serving such an impassioned&nbsp;community, and we will both continue to serve in our own ways.&nbsp;The Open Hardware Summit is a mission-driven conference. It&#8217;s non-profit, and a labour of love.&nbsp;Our aim is to continually involve more and more of the community. In that effort we are announcing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.openmaterials.org/catarina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catarina Mota&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dustynrobots.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dustyn Roberts</a>&nbsp;as the two new co-chairs for the 2012 Open Hardware Summit.</p>
<p><a href="/files/2011/12/Catarina.png"><img decoding="async" src="/files/2011/12/Catarina.png" alt="" title="Catarina" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-373" width="300" height="300"></a>&nbsp;<a href="/files/2011/12/dustin.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-374" src="/files/2011/12/dustin.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>
<address>Catarina Mota &amp; Dustyn Roberts</address>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Catarina&#8217;s expertise in Open Materials, and Dustyn&#8217;s work in open mechanisms and robotics, each will bring a unique new dimension to the term &#8220;Open Hardware&#8221; and together broaden the relevance and reach of our movement and summit.</p>
<div>
<p>Thank you all for the support, we cannot stress enough that this is&nbsp;your&nbsp;movement, and everyone here has helped make it happen. The support for the Summit, from helping hands to donations, made it possible. Please continue to support the movement as it goes forward.</p>
<p>Put your hands together for Catarina and Dustyn!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alicia &amp; Ayah</p>

<p>Thank you to all for attending, participating, supporting, <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/sponsor-2011/">sponsoring</a>, and helping the Summit be a huge success this year! Thank you to our <a href="/files/2011/09/OHprogram2011-FINALtoprint.pdf">speakers, breakout session facilitators and demo&#8217;ers</a>, the content you all shared is truly what makes the Summit exciting, captivates the audience, and accelerates discussion. And thank you for sharing your <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/documentation-2011/">slides</a>! Videos will be up soon, in the meantime check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/open_hardware_summit/sets/72157627705796086/">photos</a> from Jacob Gibb and John De Cristofaro on the Open Hardware Summit&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/open_hardware_summit/sets/72157627705796086/">flickr stream</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to our <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/sponsor-2011/">SPONSORS</a> who generously support the Summit. Each donation both from individuals and companies made a huge difference. We urge you to check out our <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/sponsor-2011/">sponsors</a>, these are the companies believing in the open source hardware movement today and sharing a very large part of what it takes to run a conference &#8211; money!</p>
<p>The Summit is completely volunteer run and non-profit. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/about/">dream team</a> and several last minute volunteers who stepped up to tasks we didn&#8217;t expect! We are so fortunate to have an amazing community full of talented, giving people &#8211; please carry the excitement of the day with you into 2012.</p>

<p>Do you have the next big Open Hardware idea, but just don&#8217;t have the funds for it?</p>
<p>The Open Hardware Summit (OHS) is announcing its first Open Hardware scholarship this year! The purpose of the OHS scholarship is to support emerging artists/inventors and developers by providing funding for works that are released as Open Source Hardware. Granting these funds is an opportunity to draw attention to the Open Source Hardware movement, to give back to the DIY community, and to give you the chance to join a growing roster of gamechangers in Open Source Hardware history. If you have a project that is in the spirit of the OHS and supports the <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OHSW definition</a>, we welcome your submissions.</p>
<p><strong>PRIZE<br />
</strong>Upwards of $2000 will be awarded. The scholarship is made available by the generous individuals and sponsors who have made the Open Hardware Summit possible.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC VOTE</strong><br />
The winner will be chosen by the public. All projects will be viewable online and voting will begin at 10am, September 14th. People will be able to vote on their favorite project remotely or onsite. The winning artist/group will be announce at the conclusion of OHS on September 15th at the New York Hall of Science</p>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br />
1. upload a 30 second (maximum) video clip to youtube that showcases the concept of your project. The title of the video MUST be the title of the work</p>
<p>2. include a short paragraph in the description of the video. Your description must start with the following sentence, and go on to explain your project in less than 500 characters.<br />
Example:<br />
&#8220;The following project is a submission to the Open Hardware Scholarship awarded by the Open Hardware Summit 2011.<br />
Project title: &#8230;<br />
Project Description:..&#8221;</p>
<p>3. email the following information to scholarship@openhardwaresummit.org :</p>

<li>email address</li>
<li>place of resident (city, state/province, country)</li>
<li>title of project</li>
<li>summary of project (500 characters max)</li>
<li>URL of video clip</li>
<li>URL of project site <a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/apply-oshw-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that includes your application of the OSHW Definition</a> (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DEADLINE<br />
</strong>For submissions is 12:00pm, September 14th EST. NO EXCEPTIONS</p>
<p><strong>NOTES:<br />
</strong>Please feel free to email scholarship@openhardwaresummit.org if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Where does the money come from? We had $2,000 USD left over from our funds last year and we thought the best way to use it is to give it back to the community.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a>, our partner in crime and catalyst to the Open Hardware Summit, will be including one (1) complimentary ticket to Maker Faire in the Open Hardware Summit goodie bag! As many people are familiar with Maker Faire in this crowd, we think you&#8217;ll be excited too.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been to Maker Faire, it&#8217;s a very a prominent and important part of the DIY movement and has extremely strong overlap with open source hardware. The New York Maker Faire is Saturday and Sunday (Sept. 17th and 18th), just 2 days after the Summit. You can check out other Maker Faires locations on the Maker Faire website: <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">makerfaire.com</a></p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll take advantage of the complimentary ticket and further support the DIY / Maker movement. The fabulous people on the Maker Faire crew have given the Summit a large amount of support from getting us hotel room blocks, and allowing us to take over <a href="http://www.nysci.org/">NYSCI</a> on one of their days, to advice about speakers and twitter. We are honored to be part of this community, standing on the shoulders of giants. We couldn&#8217;t do it without you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We at the Open hardware Summit work very hard to keep the summit accessible to all people and companies, big or small. We keep the ticket prices affordable (even with meals, cocktails, a kickass lineup and a goodie bag to die for!), we cap sponsorship levels, and we plan a scholarship for open hardware with the remaining funds. But in order to do this, we need your help! <a href="http://www.2011.oshwa.org/sponsor-2011">Please consider supporting the Open Hardware Summit 2011 by being a sponsor</a>.
